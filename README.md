# ERMapViewer

ERMapViewer is a program for viewing maps from Elden Ring in 3D. Depends on SoulsFormats (intended for use with my fork that includes sort-of support for Elden Ring .msbs).

The program is currently not anywhere near complete, so to get it working you'll probably have to mess with the code a bit (but not too much). Also note that performance is terrible right now, so be careful not to load huge maps (usually ones that end in _00 are pretty large).

The program requires you to have data1 and data2 extracted.
